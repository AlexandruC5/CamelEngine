# Genesis Engine
  Genesis Engine is a game engine made in C and C++ for learning purposes. I'm Marc Pag√®s Francesch, 
  a Game Development Student in CITM (Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain).

## Controls: 
 
  To freely move the camera in the scene, the scene window must be selected or focused.

### Camera Controls:

 - W / Up Arrow: Move Forward
 - A / Left Arrow: Move Left
 - S / Down Arrow: Move Backwards
 - D / Right Arrow: Move Right

 - Mouse Wheel: Zoom In/Out
 - Middle Mouse: Drag to move horizontally and vertically. 
 - Right Click: Orbit around the selected object. (If an object is not selected it will orbit around the center of the scene).
 - F: Focus the camera around the selected object.(If an object is not selected it will focus around the center of the scene).
 - Hold Shift: Duplicate movement speed.

 If for any reason the camera got stuck or didn't show anything on screen push R to reset it. 
 
### Game Objects Inspector actions
 - Transform: Translate, Rotate and Scale the object. 
 - Mesh: Toggle the view of the vertex and face normals. 
 - Material: 
     - Toggle the checkers image. 
     - Remove the current texture. 

### Actions in tabs:
 - Windows: Enable the engine windows. 
 - Edit: 
   - Configuration: Change the engine settings and view graphs about the performance. 

 - Game Object: There are six primitives available to be created at any time. These are: Cube, Plane, Cylinder, Sphere,
   Cone and Pyramid. These are duplicated, the firsts are generated automatically and have no texture coordinates and the 
   ones marked with FBX will be loaded from FBX files and will have texture coordinates. 

 - About: Get the pages where the project is held in GitHub and get more information about the engine.

### Scene Saving
 - Scenes can be saved and loaded from the editor main bar. Even though they can be saved anywhere it is recommended to do so in the scenes folder to keep everything organised. 

### Importing Files
 For proper file import it is recommended that the files are already inside the Assets folder before starting the engine. If they are not, files can be dragged and dropped onto the engine in order to be imported. One last way to import files is copying them in the Assets folder and push the Reload button under the Assets hierarchy in the Assets window. 

 ### Importing Options
There are plenty of importing options specially for textures. When the file is dropped onto the engine an importing window will pop up to select the desired options. The only model format supported is fbx so if a warning or error message is displayed saying that a file from a different format can't be imported, this is the reason. 

 ## Additional functionality

 ### First Assignment
 - The engine settings are loaded directly from a JSON file named config and located in GenesisEngine/Assets/Config. 
   this settings include the modules values and which windows are opened on start. 
 - When and FBX is loaded the hierarchy of the objects is mantained and the name of the objects in the FBX will be assigned
   to the new Game Object.  
 - Objects can be deleted selecting them and pressing SUPR.  

## Second Assignment
 - Scenes can be saved with custom name.
 - Textures can be previewed in the assets window.
